Phase one involves planning and building a functional web applications and systems for justb to host it’s users on. Phase one of this project should take no longer than 4 months to complete and remain within

## Phase One

The goal of phase one is build the core functionalities of justb web application that will allow a limited number of users to access justb at no cost. 

These users will primarily be teachers and students who are testing justb functionality.

Build smooth and simple functionalities to then add features as we go
